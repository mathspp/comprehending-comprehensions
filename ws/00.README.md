# Foreword

These exercises are taken from the book [“Comprehending Comprehensions”](https://mathspp.com/comprehending-comprehensions), by Rodrigo Girão Serrão.

The exercises are meant to make you work with comprehensions in general (list, dict, set, and generator expressions).
Some exercises will show good use cases for comprehensions.
Others will show bad use cases for comprehensions (along with the better alternatives).
And some exercises will be straight out bonkers.
But all of the exercises are designed to help you understand & master these concepts.

Have fun!
