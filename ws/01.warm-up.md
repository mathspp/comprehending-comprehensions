Convert the following `for` loop into a list comprehension:

```py
firsts = []
for word in "The quick brown fox jumps.".split():
    firsts.append(word[0])
```

Convert the following `for` loop into a list comprehension:

```py
names = ["Barack Obama", "Harry Potter", "Marie Curie"]

firsts = []
for name in names:
    firsts.append(name.split()[0])
```

Take a look at the list comprehensions below.
Determine what the output will be before running them.
Then, check your answers (for example, in the REPL).

```py
strings = ["Hello", "how", "ARE", "yoU", "DoiNg"]

[s for s in strings if s.isupper()]
[s for s in strings if s.islower()]
[s for s in strings if len(s) > 3]
[s for s in strings if len(s) == 5]
[s for s in strings if s > "hey"]
# If needed, use the REPL to see how string comparison works!
```

Take a look at the list comprehensions below.
Determine what the output will be before running them.
Then, check your answers (for example, in the REPL).

```py
product_prices = {
    "bread": 0.2, "chocolate": 1,
    "book": 20, "car": 20_000,
    "bed": 300, "coffee": 2,
}
want = ["bread", "book", "coffee"]
money = 25

[prod for prod in product_prices if prod.startswith("b")]
[price for prod, price in product_prices.items() if prod in want]
[prod for prod, price in product_prices.items() if price <= money]
[prod for prod, price in product_prices.items() if price > money]
```

Rewrite the list comprehensions below as calls to `filter`.
Make sure you are right by comparing the result of each list comprehension
with the result of each call to `filter`.

```py
strings = ["Hello", "how", "ARE", "yoU", "DoiNg"]

[s for s in strings if s.isupper()]
[s for s in strings if s.islower()]
[s for s in strings if len(s) > 3]
[s for s in strings if len(s) == 5]
[s for s in strings if s > "hey"]
# If needed, use the REPL to see how string comparison works!
```

Rewrite the calls to `filter` below as list comprehensions.
Make sure you are right by comparing the result of each list comprehension
with the result of each call to `filter`.


```py
numbers = [73, 0, -42, 10, -6, 5, 0, 0]

def is_length_2(num):
    return len(str(num)) == 2


list(filter(None, numbers))
list(filter(lambda num: num > 0, numbers))
list(filter(lambda num: num % 2, numbers))
list(filter(lambda num: not num % 2, numbers))
list(filter(lambda num: num % 5, numbers))
list(filter(is_length_2, numbers))
```

Rewrite the calls to `map` below as list comprehensions.
Make sure you are right by comparing the result of each list comprehension
with the result of each call to `map`.

```py
def first(t):
    return t[0]

def last(t):
    return t[-1]

people = [
    ("John", "Doe", 34),
    ("Alice", "Smith", 52),
    ("Bob", "Robinson", 22),
    ("Diana", "Clark", 28),
]

list(map(first, people))
list(map(last, people))
list(map(lambda p: p[1], people))
list(map(lambda p: p + ("alive",), people))
list(map(lambda p: p[:-1] + (last(p) + 1,), people))
