Write a function that takes an argument `n` and returns n simulated fair coin tosses.
Write a list comprehension.

Suppose we say a location is “dry” if their humidity is below `0.2`.
What locations are dry?

```py
# Some locations...
locations = ["Sahara desert", "Ica", "Big Bog", "Aoulef", "Iquique", "Tutendo"]
# ... and (made up!) humidity levels.
humidity_levels = [0.02, 0.05, 0.8, 0.1, 0.21, 0.78]
```

Do we have any palindrome prime numbers?
(Recall that a number is a palindrome if if reads the same from left to right and right to left.
For example, 121 is a palindrome but not a prime.)

```py
with open("data/primes.txt", "r") as f:
    primes = [int(line) for line in f]

print(any([...]))
```

Headers in Markdown usually start with a variable number of `"#"` characters.
Top-level headers start with a single `"#"`.
Use the built-in `enumerate` to create a table of contents for the top-level headers only.

```py
headers = [
    "# Introduction",
    "## Who am I?",
    "## Installing Python",
    "# Why Python is awesome",
    "# Conclusions",
    "## Why you should love Python by now",
    "### What to do if you don't love Python",
]

toc = list(enumerate([...], start=1))
# [(1, '# Introduction'), (2, '# Why Python is awesome'), (3, '# Conclusions')]
```

How young is the youngest person in our file?

```py
import csv

with open("data/people.csv", "r") as f:
    f.readline()  # Skip header.
    people = list(csv.reader(f))

min([...])
```

Rewrite the list comprehensions that you can see below, so that they make use of `itertools.product`.
Make sure that you still get _the exact same output_ for each one.

```py
colours = ["red", "green", "blue"]
clothing = ["trousers", "tshirt", "jacket"]

cmp1 = [f"{it} {cr}" for cr in colours for it in clothing]
cmp2 = [f"{cr} {it}" for it in clothing for cr in colours]
cmp3 = [f"{cr} {it}" for cr in colours for it in clothing]
cmp4 = [f"{it} {cr}" for it in clothing for cr in colours]
```

Rewrite the structure below as a list comprehension.

```py
my_list = []
for it2 in it1:
 for _ in it3:
  if p1(it2):
   for it4 in it2:
    for v1 in it4:
     if p2(v1):
      if p3(it4):
       for it6 in it5:
        for v2, it7 in it6:
         for v3, it8, it9 in it7:
          if p2(v1):
           for v4, v5 in zip(it8, it9):
            my_list.append(func(v1, v2, v3, v4, v5))
```

Take a look at the code below.
Rewrite it with two nested comprehensions.
(Maybe start by rewriting `inner` as a list comprehension?)

```py
result = []
for i in range(3):
    inner = []
    for j in range(3):
        inner.append((3 * i + j) ** 2)
    result.append(inner)
```
