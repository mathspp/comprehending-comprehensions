Rewrite the loop below as a set comprehension.

```py
letter_bags = set()
with open("data/wordlist.txt", "r") as f:
    for line in f:
        letter_bags.add(frozenset(line.strip()))
```

Take a look at the code below and run it.

First of all, what's an anagram? (Google it!)
How long does it take to run?

```py
def sign(word):
    """Return the "anagram signature" of a word."""
    return "".join(sorted(word))

anagram_signatures = []
with open("data/wordlist.txt", "r") as f:
    for line in f:
        signature = sign(line.strip())
        if signature not in anagram_signatures:
            anagram_signatures.append(signature)
```

After you created the list `anagram_signatures`, how quickly can you check if a new word is an anagram of _any_ of the ones already accounted for in `anagram_signatures`?

Rewrite the above so that `anagram_signatures` is a set and the code inside the context manager is a set comprehension.

What is the value of the variable `names` after running the snippet below?

```py
nums = [42, 73, 0, 16, 10]
names_ = ["forty two", "seventy three", "zero", "sixteen", "ten"]
names = {num: name for num, name in zip(nums, names_)}
```

Replace the dictionary comprehension with a call to `dict`.

---

Write a dictionary comprehension that builds the dictionary shown below:

```py
months = [
    "January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July",
    "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"
]

mapping = ...  # {'Jan': 'january', 'Feb': 'february', ..., 'Dec': 'december'}
```

Consider the dictionary `product_prices` and the integer `money`:

```py
product_prices = {
    "bread": 0.2, "chocolate": 1,
    "book": 20, "car": 20_000,
    "bed": 300, "coffee": 2,
}
money = 25
```

Create a dictionary that maps product names from `product_prices` to Boolean values.
Products that you can afford, as defined by the integer `money`, should be mapped to `True` and products that you cannot afford should be mapped to `False`.
Here are two examples:

```py
can_afford = ...
print(can_afford["bread"])  # True
print(can_afford["car"])  # False
```
