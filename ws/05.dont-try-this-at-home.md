Use a list comprehension and the walrus operator `:=` (the operator for assignment expressions) to reimplement `itertools.accumulate`.

What.
The.
Hell...
What's going on in the code below?
What are these list comprehensions doing?!

```py
(
    lambda: [
        [
            main()
            for sys in [__import__("sys")]
            for math in [__import__("math")]
            for sub in [lambda *vals: None]
            for echo in [
                lambda *vals: sub(sys.stdout.write(" ".join(map(str, vals)) + "\n"))
            ]
            for Cylinder in [
                type(
                    "Cylinder",
                    (object,),
                    dict(
                        __init__=lambda self, radius, height: sub(
                            setattr(self, "radius", radius),
                            setattr(self, "height", height),
                        ),
                        volume=property(
                            lambda self: self.height * self.radius**2 * math.pi
                        ),
                    ),
                )
            ]
            for main in [
                lambda: sub(
                    [
                        echo(
                            f"A cylinder with a radius of {my_radius:.1f} and a height of {my_height:.1f} has a volume of {my_cylinder.volume:.1f}"
                        )
                        for factor in [1, 2, 3]
                        for my_radius, my_height in [[10 * factor, 20 * factor]]
                        for my_cylinder in [Cylinder(my_radius, my_height)]
                    ]
                )
            ]
        ],
    ]
)()
```
